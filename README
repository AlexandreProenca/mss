Mandriva Server Setup aims to help system administrators to setup quickly 
system services such as DNS and OpenLDAP through a web interface.

In order to run MSS you have to start mss-agent (XML-RPC service) and 
mss-www (Web server) daemons.

MSS web interface is available from your web browser at https://localhost:8000.

If you want to develop your own modules for MSS have a look in /usr/share/doc/mss/.
